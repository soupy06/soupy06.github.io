            Sunrise mart is a place where I used to go when I was younger, it is a place of nostalgia and comfort. Unfortunately, this specific location closed down.

                    Perhaps in the midst of this teeming city that shelters the poor and rich, there would be a place where everyone is put at ease. A place of nostalgia that holds such a strong tie to people, it grows a part of their routine. My mom and I once had a place like that: a small Japanese grocery store named Sunrise Mart, full of my childhood memories. It rested atop a bakery to avoid being noticed from the disorder of the city. Perhaps I might be too sentimental about that supermarket.

                    My mom held my hand tightly and waltzed around New York City with little me. She has an eye for small shops, and Sunrise Mart did not slip her radar. Sunrise Mart was a Japanese grocery store in Stuyvesant Square, hidden above a bakery, and not seen unless you looked hard enough. When we first visited, the elevator had a wait of what felt like an eternity. A pleasant ding was followed by the doors opening and people piling into the elevator. I fit snugly into the crowd, careful not to lose sight of my mom even though she was right next to me. Alas, we arrived. From the moment I stepped in, I was not hit with the smell of fruits and vegetables, but of a home. A lady welcomed me with a warm smile, and in exchange I showed her my biggest grin. I held my mom’s hand tight as I walked through the narrow aisles, humming to 2016’s hits blasting from the speakers, which I thought was the hottest thing ever. I tuned into the daily chatter of what to have for dinner over phone calls. I noticed the sunlight blossoming throughout the store, making it blush yellow as if I were stuck in a vintage film. From afar, I saw cheap snacks stacked in an overfilled pile waiting to be picked up by my small hands. Across the condiments section, I watched the workers neatly arrange daikon and yam into wooden boxes. I glimpsed at the nonchalant expressions on people’s faces, for this was just another visit to restock their kitchens. My senses were embraced by the essence of home.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet the next time I visited, the elevator was broken. I went through the maze of a restaurant's kitchen to find the stairs, and then finally met what I thought would be the welcoming warmth of the store. But this time, it was cold. There was no one greeting me by the entrance. I was not ten years old. My mom was not holding my hand. Maybe it only felt different because I was fifteen, and exploring the store was not anything new. Maybe the snacks had become overpriced, and I no longer liked 2016’s greatest hits. The air sat still as I listened to 2022’s playlist from my phone. I no longer heard the daily discussions about dinner, but instead loud voices in awe of the novelty foods. My nose was met with the scent of something that was going to escape my fingers because I could not grasp it hard enough. Despite the unfamiliar changes, the sunlight still poured in through the windows, the snacks were still in overflowing piles, and the daikons and yams were still neatly arranged into wooden boxes.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Going there was something inevitable. My feet moved on their own to get to my secondary home. Each departure and arrival had not meant anything to me yet. But when Sunrise Mart left, it was like there had been a big hole dug up from where it used to stand. When it was gone, the block had deteriorated into a ghost town. There is something that we know: something so irreplaceable and dreadful because the day will come eventually. We fail to notice something that is quickly leaving, flaunting its signs of “I’m going to run away now!” Gone is this short-lived feeling of normalcy when coming back from a long day. We are so accustomed to this ever changing city that when the usual changes, it does not hit us as quickly as it is supposed to. Before you know it, your middle school is closed down, your favorite restaurant is gone, and your childhood library is under renovation. Before you notice a closing sign wrapped in clear plastic, before you realize something is gone. We all know that regretful feeling. The ghost of nostalgia, we shall cherish it in our memories.
